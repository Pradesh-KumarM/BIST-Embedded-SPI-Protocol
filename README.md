# BIST-Embedded-SPI-Protocol
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) Embedded Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Protocol.   The BIST framework enables autonomous fault detection in SPI communication systems without external testing equipment, ensuring improved reliability and faster verification.
